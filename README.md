# 🎲 Number Guessing Game

A simple and entertaining command-line game where the player attempts to guess a number that was randomly generated between 1 and 100.

## 🧠 Mechanics of Play

- The computer chooses a random number between **1 and 100**.
- The player is asked to guess the number.
- The game informs the player if the guess was too high or too low.
- The player guesses until setting upon the right number or choosing to exit.
- Attempts made will be recorded and displayed upon victory.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x

No external libraries are needed beside Python's built-in `random` module.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the code to a file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `guessing_game.py`).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt window.
3. Run the file with:

   ```bash
   python guessing_game.py
````
